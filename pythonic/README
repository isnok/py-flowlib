# flowtool-python

A collection of functions helpful for python development.

## Contents

The `flowtool-python` package currently contains one new command for `flowtool`:

* `py-clean` - recursively cleans temporary files (`*.pyc`) and directories (`__pycache__`).

Secondly it brings some git hooks:

* `pylint-minimal` - (pre-commit, commit-msg) - checks all python source files added to the commit with pylint and a minimalistic config
* `pylint-commit-range` - (pre-push) - checks all python source files that differ from origin/master on push
* `pytest-hook` - (pre-commit, commit-msg) - run pytest in all dirs containing a `pytest.ini` or `tox.ini`
