# flowtool-githooks-demo

This package contains some example git hooks.

The hooks are made runnable via `console_scripts` entry points.
The hooks are also recognized by the `flowtool-githooks` management via entry points.
That just means for a user of this tool, that the hooks will show up in the
`ft githooks-scripts` menu automatically, and can also be run via their name from
the command line.

## Setting things up

```shell
$ pip install flowtool-githooks-demo
```
Then you can install the hook runner and set up the demo hook by using these commands:

```shell
$ flowtool githooks-install
$ flowtool githooks-scripts --hook pre-commit --add _flowtool_githooks.demo
$ flowtool githooks-scripts --hook commit-msg --add _flowtool_githooks.demo
$ flowtool githooks-scripts --hook pre-push --add _flowtool_githooks.demo
```

To configure the hooks interactively:

```shell
$ flowtool githooks-scripts --help
$ flowtool githooks-scripts
```

To unistall the hooks use:

```shell
$ flowtool githooks-scripts --hook pre-commit --remove _flowtool_githooks.demo
$ flowtool githooks-wipe
```

## _flowtool_githooks.demo

A git hook to showcase the possibilities of git hooks.
It prints its (command line) arguments and various information
that may or may not be interesting to someone developing a hook
for his own purposes.

As one main feature, it reads it's standard input non-blocking
and outputs it if there is anything, since only some hooks get
additional information passed in via stdin.

## _flowtool_githooks.demo_fail

A git hook that will always fail.

Good to test what a non-zero exit status will do for certain hooks.


## _flowtool_githooks.shellcheck

A step towards a collection of git hooks, that wrap code checkers.
This one wraps [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck),
a shell script syntax, style and security checker.
