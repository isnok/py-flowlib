Source Links
------------

The main executable (i.e. the `flowtool` and `ft` command) is implemented
in the module :ref:`src.flowtool.main`.

The module :ref:`src.flowtool.info` contains the source code of the `self-info`
command. It can be used to retrieve some runtime/environment information, that
can be helpful for debugging `flowtool`.

The command `self-update` is implemented in the module :ref:`src.flowtool.update`.
It can be used to conveniently keep flowtool and it's subcomponents up to date.
