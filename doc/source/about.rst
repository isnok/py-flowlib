why flowtool?
=============

The development of flowtool is currently driven by my (the Author's) personal requirements.
My vision is to create some solutions here for things that i used to solve with small shell
scripts. These solutions then mutated their own features, that i would then miss in another
version of it. So, in order to keep these tiny solutions kind of "standardized", i reduce
overhead, and solve things on a more general level. This isn't always easier, but pays off
a lot in the long run. Like not so many people test their release-scripts, but in production.


The project exists for over a year now, and i had already put it aside,
when the need for it suddenly arose again (and again in a professional
environment), so i came to revive it.

Since this is the second attempt, and all in general about the third to fourth
rewrite of some portions of the code, I decided to do some things different
this time. This time i wanted to take the time (and effort!) to evaluate the right
solutions for greater features beforehand, and then still try to develop a solution,
that as loosely coupled with the whole system as possible. Through that i am hoping
to be able to develop a complex system built from powerful components, that have a
high value in terms of reusablility.
