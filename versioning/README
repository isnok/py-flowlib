# flowtool-versioning

Automatic versions from git tags.

This addon lets you deploy a small versioning framework into your python
project, that integrates well with setuptools and probably also distutils.

The framework itself has no dependencies but python.
It is verified-to-work with python 2.7 and 3.4 releases.

To test it out, run one of these commands:
```
flowtool versioning-init
flowtool versioning-update
```
in a folder that contains a file named `setup.py`.
You will then be asked where the versionfile (that contains the version
information) should be placed, and wether you want to include some default
snippets into `setup.cfg` and `__init__.py` to configure and use the version
in your project. It will also create a file named `versioning.py` next to your
`setup.py` before giving you some information on how to wire things up in
`setup.py` from there.

Once you have it wired into your `setup.py` (same process as
`python-versioneer`) and created a tag with your chosen prefix (`setup.cfg`,
prefix can be empty also) to bootstrap automatic versioning, you should be
able to run:
```
./versioning.py     # outputs the current version
./setup.py version  # get more detailed current version info
./setup.py bump     # create a new tag, with a minorly bumped version
./setup.py sdist release  # release is upload and git push + tags
```
