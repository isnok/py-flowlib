# flowtool-versioning

Automatic versions from git tags.

This addon lets you deploy a small versioning framework
that integrates with setuptools and probably also distutils.

To test it out, run `flowtool init-versioning` in a folder
containing a setup.py that is also under git version control
and follow the instructions.

Once you have it wired into your `setup.py` and a tag with your
prefix (can be empty also) exists, you should be able to run:
```
./setup.py version  # get current version info
./setup.py bump     # create a new tag, with a minorly bumped version
./setup.py sdist release  # release is upload and git push + tags
```
