# flowtool-releasing

An automated workflow for releasing Python Packages to PyPI and github.

Requires `flowtool-versioning` to be in place, and at least one tag created.

The release process works as follows:

- check that the repo is clean (and that we are not exactly at a release)
- bump the version of the project (by creating a new git tag)
- run `git push` and `git push --tags`
- release to PyPI (mainly `setup.py sdist upload`)

It add the following commands to `flowtool`:
```
flowtool release-now      # make a release
flowtool release-cleanup  # clean up older tags on the local repo
```
