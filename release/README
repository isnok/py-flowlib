# flowtool-releasing

An automated workflow for releasing Python Packages to PyPI and github.

Requires `flowtool-versioning` to be up-and-running (installed and at least one tag created).

The release process works as follows:

- check that the repo is clean (and that we are not exactly at a release)
- bump the version of the project (by creating a new git tag)
- run `git push` and `git push --tags`
- release to PyPI (mainly `setup.py sdist upload`)

It add the following commands to `flowtool`:
```
flowtool release-now         # make a release
flowtool clean-tags          # clean up older tags on the local repo
flowtool clean-tags 1 -a -y  # clean up all older tags and keep only the latest
```

If you want to use it in your project, try it out, and request more
documentation when you need it.
